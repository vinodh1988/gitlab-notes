First Pipeline?

Static Website?
----------------
  Just Html code no back code 
  all we need is a hosting environment/webserver
  to deploy it
  
  
  gitlab itself  provides hosting facility
  to hosting a static website
  in a feature called gitlab pages
  
  and in every project youcreate
  they give you gitlab pages space
  
  and you can host
  your static code
  
  to make it work
  you have to put your website
  source code in a folder
  named public
