Team?

    Challenges
	--------------
	
	  Team of developers/testers/operation
	  everyone works with same code base but for different purposes
	  
	  developers
				1. developing new code
				2. modifying/maintaing existing code
				3. patching small pieces of code in existing code
				4. unit test code
				
	  Testers
	  
				1. Testing code
				
	  Operation team
	  
				1. Will use the deployable code 
				to deploy in the infra
				
in order make the work flow smooth we maintain
the single repository with different branch


main - single point of truth (which is usually protected
not easily allowed to accessed directly by developers,testers)

if a new feature is developed by a developers

the developer would create a new branch from main
and start developing in their own feature branch
and push code into feature branch of the central repository

we will not allow to merge in main repository directly


The user after pushing the code (feature branch) to central
repo , should make a request to the concerned people
with permissions(team lead,code reviewers) to merge
your code to the main

this request is called as MergeRequest (gitlab)/ PullRequest(bitbucket
,github,azure repos)

upon approval the code will be merged
