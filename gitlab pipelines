Continous Integration/Continous Deployment/Delivery

Continous Integration
----------------------

if a code is commited to a target branch

 if we automatically
 
    load the code
	verify the code whether it is secured?
	if we compile it
    build it
	and package it and store it in a artifact(end files
	that are created) repository
	
	this is called continous integration
	
	
continous deployment
------------------------

upon succesful completion 
of CI

if the the packaged
application is deployed
on specific target
( VMs,Webservers
,cloud services,
container services)

	
	We do this multiple stages
	like
	
	fetch the code
	build stage
	testing stage
	deployment stage
	
	
In gitlab 
we do this through script
(yaml configuration)

the ci/cd script
is called pipeline

and it is 
generally written in a file called
.gitlab-ci.yml

There is a program/agent
called gitlab runner
in the gitlab cloud
to take care of the 
execution of your pipeline

and gitlab 
runs the pipeline
on containers
