Next Case Study
-----------------

A Common Docker based build pipeline


if a project is containerization project

Continous integration
-------------------------

    build the code (if necassary)
	
	docker build  (the project must have Dockerfile)
	 
	          outcome: a docker image is created
			  
	docker push
	          outcome: the docker image will be stored in docker hub
			  
	
Continous delivery
--------------------

      Target:  kubernetes, openshift, ecs...
	  
	  According to the target
	  
	  we may write yaml instructions
	  to pick the image
	  store in docker hub
	  from the previous stage
	  
	  and deploy it in the target(
	  
	  kubernetes,openshift....)
